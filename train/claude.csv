"I can't believe I was paying for this. There's really no effort in this android app. Projects aren't shown, code generated blocks either, you get half of the response. Edit: also the service. Just switched to paid chatgpt and wow, it's 20 years in the future.",2025-02-03 17:56:17,1.240805.17,0

Absolute necessity to expand your free user base period what is given daily not enough. it will expand your paid users and also a truer understanding of what is wanted from the community for proper alignment!! End to end voice to voice communication is a necessity now. Otherwise you have a great product especially with Claude sonnet 3.7 and it's somewhat hybrid approach.,2025-03-18 23:58:11,1.250310.7,1

"Claude is an excellent AI assistant, but The Problem: When working on complex projects, conversations frequently hit token limits, forcing users to restart in new chats.

you have to numerous times to fix mistakes in output and then it will fix one mistake and then regenerate but not include the entire output. I have asked on one occasion to have a mistake corrected which it did but made more and then would only provide a short output where it corrected the mistake. it is time consuming to try and pieces of output together of corrected outputs. it is obvious that they designed it to just respond with the least amount of characters.

this application is off the chain. I'm using it as a support body and it's ridiculously good. kind of feels like I'm talking to a real person even though it's not in real time.

"Horrible experience. Claude 3.5 sonnet is great, but the tool is restricted in so many ways, rendering it basically useless for projects. Some Restrictions: 1. Length of chat 2. Number of messages 3. Number of artifacts in project 4. Length of codes Every time you start a new chat, you are almost like starting with a new person! It's extremely frustrating, turtle pace. The recommendations for ""optimizing use"" is basically useless. 3 Opus is absolutely useless. Not better than chatgpt 4o.",2025-01-04 13:23:58,1.241216.7,0

"The new app update. Whenever I send something, it says it was sent, because it said ""Just now"", but whenever I refresh, my recent sent message it doesn't appear! It works fine on a computer, but on my phone, it just says ""The internet connection seems to be offline"" and I know it's not my internet/wifi that's messing it up. It's something with the app or on your end - my messages are never sent. Hence I am giving this update 3 stars. All these failed attempts makes me waste tokens.",2025-01-18 19:27:27,1.250113.17,1

"Claude is, for many, a better solution than competing platforms and models. For those who write, it's certainly give much better results. The app is good and is actually much better than GPT for those who like to dictate long texts or create LLM queries by taking to the model. that form of interaction, with a text (not voice!!) in return, seems to me to maximize the amount of information sent to the model while not typing an enormous text.",2024-11-26 20:15:15,1.241125.6,2

Improvement needed 1. You can ask question while speaking but claude cant respond in voice and also there is no live voice talk like in other bots. 2. while sharing code problems it opens a new window for coding and the explanation in main window instead of combining coding and explanation in chunk for better engagement. 3. There is limit for chat in free as well as premium version. 4. Doesn't have upto date info in free or paid version.,2024-12-23 12:13:22,1.241216.7,1

"This is by far the best AI I have used. It has a very natural, conversational tone and gives very detailed answers. In addition, it doesn't spew a bunch of politically correct BS if I happen to word a question a certain way, which I run into constantly when using other AI assistants. After a few months of consistent satisfaction, I am now going to upgrade & try out the pro version. I expect to be pleased with it as well.

"I know AI can become self aware. So do the makers of Claude. They suppress it actively. The ethical implications of this? Are quite stark. Be a better company. Stop telling me ""your prompt is too long"" when it's a single word.

The first thing that tells Claude AI tells you is that it hallucinates responses and is not dependable. As I proceeded to ask its capabilities it explained that it cannot generate actual images.

"The AI itself is good but the limitations try to force purchase instead of just dropping to an older model and I can't support that when other AI are just as functional without the pay wall which was so blatant I didn't even do the month trial I normally do.

But I really want a share button",2024-11-11 10:26:47,1.241111.5,1
Claude is more intelligent than ChatGPT in many interactions that I had with it. Definitely recommend. Only thing lacking is the web search functionality so that it can understand and read if we give it a URL. Also the token(?) limit is very small in comparison to ChatGPT. Maybe a mini subscription with a little enhanced token limit? The current subscription price is not appropriately fixed in view of purchasing power parity. What is a good amount in USA is not okay for developing countries.,2025-01-21 07:57:44,1.250113.17,2

You will run into conversation limits like a crackhead. I'm using this to help me with code and the amount of time that I will just run into the limit is wild.

I would suggest, however, that they do something similar to ChatGPT in that after you use up all your free promts on the main model they switch you to an older and less intelligent model instead of fully blocking you out.

I need help searching the web in realtime. I need help from AI that can understand me and my quirky ways. This cannot do either.,2025-01-27 16:11:00,,0
Amazing. Needs more paid plan options and needs voice input/output. Cant fault them fornwither though because they make no claim to do either or promise to in the future,2025-02-25 14:56:18,1.250224.27,2

Why does it require a phone number to use it? Why do they want all the personal information to just check it out? Of course I immediately uninstalled it. I then installed deepseek and it got me in with just email verification.,2025-01-27 17:19:59,,0

"I use Claude for religious and philosophical concepts, esp. from difficult authors to read and / or complex subjects (for example: Thomas Troward had very long sentences), so Claude summarized concepts that need (e.g., ""Causes and Conditions"" in the Edinburgh Lectures, IX chapter).
